## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
** javascript**
* HOW DO COMPUTER FIT IN WITH THE WORLD AROUND?
 computer creates models --> models use objects-->programmers write codes--> browsers use html to create model of web page---> write code that uses the browser model
** HTML,CSS,JS FIT 2GETHER**
* the content of web page lives in html, enhanced and represented by css and finally being interactive by js.
** CREATING BASIC JS**
* 1ST :CREATE FOLDER TO PUT YOUR CODE, 2ND:DESIGN YOUR FOLDER WITH CSS, 3RD: SAVE IT .HTML, 4TH:VIEW THE SOURCE CODE<>
A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.

A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded web page. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way. Even though a web page can be dynamic on the client-side, it can still be hosted on a static hosting service such as GitHub Pages or Amazon S3 as long as there isn't any server-side code included.

A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using AJAX technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using AJAX, the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The AJAX engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.
