# About JavaScript Programming
Prototype based Object-oriented - JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. It used prototypes instead of classes. Objects are used to represent the real-world entity in the program.

Interpreted Language - JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. It uses just-in-time compilation technique at run-time.

Event-Based Programming - JavaScript allows us to write codes that are executed differently under different events.

Platform Independence - JavaScript codes are run on browsers. So irrespective of the machine, if the browser supports JavaScript, codes can run.

# JS language basics
+ **Variables** are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less recommended, dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable

+ **Comments** are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS
+ An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.
+ **Conditionals** are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if ... else statement. 
+ **Functions** are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions previously
