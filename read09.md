# What is a text editor?
The formal definition is: “A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.”

Essentially, a text editor is a program on you computer that allows you to create and edit a range of programming language files. AKA this is the place where you write your code!

Text editors handle “hand coding” many different languages, i.e.: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and so forth.
## Features to Look for in a Text Editor
When it comes to text editors, there are common features that they all share. It’s what makes a text editor a text editor. Here are a few:

+ Easy to use and navigate (similar to a good word processor)
+ Find and replace feature (so you can change a single word in the whole file with a few clicks)
+ Cut, Copy, Paste (again, similar to word processors)
+ Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text (also unlike a word processor)
+ Syntax highlighting (unlike your word processor, this makes it easier to read code and pick up any errors)
+ Customizable appearance (such as modifying font size, color schemes, etc., of your editor which optimizes your work zone)
+ Extensibility – (provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced)
