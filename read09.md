# What is a text editor?
The formal definition is: “A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files.”

Essentially, a text editor is a program on you computer that allows you to create and edit a range of programming language files. AKA this is the place where you write your code!

Text editors handle “hand coding” many different languages, i.e.: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, and so forth.
## Features to Look for in a Text Editor
When it comes to text editors, there are common features that they all share. It’s what makes a text editor a text editor. Here are a few:

+ Easy to use and navigate (similar to a good word processor)
+ Find and replace feature (so you can change a single word in the whole file with a few clicks)
+ Cut, Copy, Paste (again, similar to word processors)
+ Ability to handle UTF-8 encoded text (also unlike a word processor)
+ Syntax highlighting (unlike your word processor, this makes it easier to read code and pick up any errors)
+ Customizable appearance (such as modifying font size, color schemes, etc., of your editor which optimizes your work zone)
+ Extensibility – (provide some plugin mechanism, or is scriptable, so a programmer can customize the editor with additional features – this is more advanced)

# A command-line interface (CLI)
 processes commands to a computer program in the form of lines of text.

 The program which handles the interface is called a command-line interpreter or command-line processor. Operating systems implement a command-line interface in a shell for interactive access to operating system functions or services. Such access was primarily provided to users by computer terminals starting in the mid-1960s, and continued to be used throughout the 1970s and 1980s on VAX/VMS, Unix systems and personal computer systems including DOS, CP/M and Apple DOS.

Today, many users rely upon graphical user interfaces and menu-driven interactions. However, some programming and maintenance tasks may not have a graphical user interface and may still use a command line.

Alternatives to the command line interface include text-based user interface menus (for example, IBM AIX SMIT), keyboard shortcuts, and various desktop metaphors centered on the pointer (usually controlled with a mouse). Examples of this include the Microsoft Windows, DOS Shell, and Mouse Systems PowerPanel. Command-line interfaces are often implemented in terminal devices that are also capable of screen-oriented text-based user interfaces that use cursor addressing to place symbols on a display screen.
#More About Files
A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
In other systems such as Windows the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is. Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is. So for instance I could have a file myself.png which is a picture of me. I could rename the file to myself.txt or just myself and Linux would still happily treat the file as an image file. As such it can sometimes be hard to know for certain what type of file a particular file is. Luckily there is a command called file which we can use to find this out.
