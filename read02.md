##  Git 
Version Control system have a recording changes property that allows tracking  and determining mistakes within project 
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.while for team programming work a  centralized system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, 
which can be accessed by all team members and allows programmers to access team members’ activities with certain files,
and permit them to control over divvying up revision privileges.and in case of corruption of a central database’s hard disk,Distributed Version Control (DVCS?) allows clients
to create mirrored repositories that act as data backups which can be easily be placed on the server to replace any information lost.
Git is a DVCS that stores commit system made up of snapshotsand it relies mostly on elies on local operations and as a result it allows for process expediency and also allws one to continue work on a project even when not online
