##  Git clearifying 
Version Control system,vcs have a recording changes property that allows tracking and determining mistakes within project 
for aprogrammer , Local VCS entails one database on the hard disk that stores changes to files, while for team programming work a centralized system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by all team members and allows programmers to access team members’ activities with certain files,
and permit them to control over divvying up revision privileges.
in case of corruption of a central database’s hard disk,Distributed Version Control allows clients to create mirrored repositories that act as data backups which can easily be placed on the server to replace any information lost.
***Git is a DVCS that stores commit system made up of snapshots*** 
+and it relies mostly on local operations and as a result it allows for process expediency and also allows one to continue work on a project even when not online
